Created in collaboration with my brother.

* Each base is printed as 2 seperate parts (ideally on a DLP or other high resolution 3d printer)  
* Place 12x2mm magnets inside each base, then glue on the cap
* STL files included for 25mm, 32mm, and 40mm bases (units are mm)

If you need another size, submit an issue with feature request, and I will try to add it.

The file "Warhammer Model Bases v6.f3d" is an archive for Autodesk Fusion 360, which you can import to make your own modifications or versions. Fusion 360 is free for personal use.
